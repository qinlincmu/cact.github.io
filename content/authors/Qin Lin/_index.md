Qin Lin is a tenure-track assistant professor at the EECS department, Cleveland State University. Prior to joining CSU, he was a postdoc at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. His advisor is Prof. John M. Dolan. His research interests are in the intersection of machine learning, control theory, and formal verification towards the goal to enhance security and safety of safety-critical cyber-physical systems whilst deployed in dynamic, uncertain, and adversarial environments. He develops explainable and verifiable machine learning-based intrusion detection algorithms to protect industrial control systems, such as water treatment plants, from cyber attacks. He also rigorously verifies safety properties of learning-enabled components and develops safety-guaranteed planning and control algorithms for autonomous driving systems.
